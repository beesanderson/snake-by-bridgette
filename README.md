# Bridgette Sanderson's JavaScript Snake Game

Welcome to my first ever rendition of the classic Snake Game written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS! 

My original intent wasn't to make this project public but as time went on due to time constraint in project development for my portfolio I am slowly and reluctantly
beginning to open up some of my "private" or "personal" GitHub repositories just to show some of the work I've been doing quitely on my own. 

The features I was working on creating were a bit ambitious for a "rookie" such as myself as I'd had **alot** of fun ideas for them but **not** alot of time (*if any*) to create then implement them. As time goes on I will continue to develop this project but as of now this is my boilerplate, fully functional **MVP** snake game...aka a *taste of whats to come!*


## To install -
Your choice of download. It will be hosted on my portfolio, [bridgettesanderson.com]( https://bridgettesanderson.com/snake-by-bridgette/) temporarily until I finish my *actual* portfolio projects. 

## A bit about this game...
I created this project from start to finish in 3 days. I originally made a seperate snake game project along side the Scrimba [Snake Game Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/snakegame)
and went on once completed to make my own from scratch without it "hand holding" my code from point a to point b. From there I learned how to make a hamburger
navigation menu (for the first time) with help from [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At4B7A4GOPg)'s quick navbar tutorial. These both taught me the fundementals
in JavaScript DOM manipulation and responsive web app structure (in regards to the hamburger menu navigation bar.) 

I will also be uploading some, perhaps even **all**, of the notes I'd taken while working through this project initially with the Scrimba instructor as well as once I branched off on my own.

This app was made with JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS5 using best practices and will eventually be refactored for SEO optimization with the outmost attention made in
accessibility best practices by way of the Ally Project's ([A11yProject.com](https://www.a11yproject.com/)) accessibility best practices [checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/). One of my major areas of focus is in Accessibility & proper HTML/CSS Semantics for future developer's ease of use (as well as Technical Documentation.)

I developed this project using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my [Source Code](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-use-of-code-editor) Editor. Please refer to link for further detail (if you're a entry level beginner.) 

Below is my *Step by Step Guide on how to Download and Edit a Public Repository on GitHub* for beginner developers that links to several GitHub Docs I wish that someone had directed me to when I was an absolutely "green" developer.

First things first...[What is a Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories) and what is a [Remote Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories) and how do I download one? To create your **first repository** *AND* impress your friends, please check out [this walkthrough from GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) to get started :D 

## To run: 
1. To download and edit this code yourself, you may [clone this repository](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5143119/what-does-cloning-a-github-repository-mean) or [download the zip file](https://www.howtogeek.com/178146/htg-explains-everything-you-need-to-know-about-zipped-files/) or [use a password protected SSH Key](https://jdblischak.github.io/2014-09-18-chicago/novice/git/05-sshkeys.html#:~:text=An%20SSH%20key%20is%20an,%2C%20you're%20granted%20access.) for extra security. (Not very beginner friendly...and honestly not needed for something like this.)
2. To [clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) please refer to GitHub Docs's "How To" article previously linked. This is a step by step guide that will walk you through the basics of cloning and then opening another user's GitHub Repository. 
  - You may also download the [Zip File](https://www.itprotoday.com/development-techniques-and-management/how-do-i-download-files-github) which will download a compressed version of the source code for this project that you can open on your preferred code editor. (** Mine is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 
  -   - You may also select the SSH Key option. You will have to make sure you have the correct credentials in order to do so beforehard (as this option grants you added security when interacting with public repositories and cause you to need a key for each "pull/push" request.) See [SSH Key How To](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) for a Step by Step Guide from GitHub Docs on how to do this.
  - ** though VS Code is very straight forward and easy to use it may or may not be the best format for you to start off with. I know when I first downloaded it I was so overwhelmed and had a surprisingly difficult time finding decent and "Entry Level" friendly tutorials on how to use it that weren't convuluted, long, promotion heavy, or etc. I've personally found [CodePen.com](https://codepen.io/pen/) the most straightforward, easy to use, and beginner friendly...at least for me as I am queen of the Silly Billy's! ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‰ If you're at that entry level know I WAS THERE MYSELF TOO and before you know it you'll be writing your own JavaScript Snake Game like I did ðŸ¥²

2. If you have the VS Code extension, [Live Server](ritwickdey.liveserver), it will be incredibly easy for you to start up the web app! Simply right click while in the `index.html` file (located in the [root of the project](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-root-folder-or-root-directory-2625989), or "fancy dev talk" meaning in the default or ["parent" folder](https://www.yourdictionary.com/parent-folder),) you will be able to find the "*Open With Live Server*" option. If you don't have this extension downloaded, please consider it as it makes Front-End Development much more easy and convenient! [Watch this Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzE0yqwbdgU) on a quick tutorial on how to do this for further instruction. 

3. From there you should be able to check it out for yourself! Give it a try and let me know what you think! PS --- AWESOME JOB!!!!
