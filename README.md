# Bridgette Sanderson's Snake Game
Welcome to my first ever rendition of the classic Snake Game written in JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3!

My original intent wasn't to make this project public but as time went on due to time constraint in project development for my portfolio I am slowly and reluctantly beginning to open up some of my "private" or "personal" GitHub repositories just to show some of the work I've been doing quietly on my own.

This project's future features were quite ambitious for a "rookie" such as myself as I've had alot of ideas for features but not a lot of time (if any!) to implement them. As time goes on I will continue to develop this project but as of now this is the "boilerplate" MVP of my game...aka a bit of a taste of what's to come!

## To install -
Your choice of download. It will be hosted at my portfolio for the time being. To actually install and run on your own PC refer to the "*A bit about this game....*" section further down in README.md file.

## A bit about this game...
I made this from "start to scratch" in 4 days! That is really quick considering how long ago I started learning how to code! I started learning how to code in June of 2021 and this was completed on October 27th 2021! I did the original code along with a tutorial from one of my favorite Developer education companies, [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) and then I took it from there with designing and styling the project all on my own! I also remade the project's JavaScript code without any "*hand-holding*" from the tutorial as well to make sure I understood it. This was also the first time that I ever made a *Hamburger Menu* styled navbar! I found a simplistic boilerplate [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At4B7A4GOPg&t=600s), and took it from there! I am still not fully done with what I have envisioned but was so excited to finally have a project I'm willing to display for my portfolio I figured that this will be a good way to show off my work! (Also, show off the work that is to come in the "*About*" and "*Mode FAQ*" pages of the web app!)

I will also be uploading some, perhaps even **all**, of the notes I'd taken while working through this project initially with the Scrimba instructor as well as once I branched off on my own.

This app was made with JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS5 using best practices and will eventually be refactored for SEO optimization with the outmost attention made in accessibility best practices by way of the Ally Project's (A11yProject.com) accessibility best practices checklist.


## To run: 
1. I developed this using VS-Code. Because it is a very simple and straight forward project you should be able to just download the zip. From there just open it up with VS Code and navigate to the `index.html` file in the root of the project. 

2. If you have the VS Code extension, [Live Server](ritwickdey.liveserver), it will be incredibly easy for you to start up the web app! By right clicking while in the `index.html` file (located in the root of the project) you should be able to find the "*Open With Live Server*" option. If you don't have this extension downloaded, please consider it as it makes Front-End Development much more easy and convenient! 

3. From there you should be able to check it out for yourself! Give it a try and let me know what you think! 

A11yProject.com is one of the richest important resources for Web Developers in this day and age. Please use their guidelines and checklists to ensure that those disabled among us are able to fully enjoy the internet as much as the rest of us!!
