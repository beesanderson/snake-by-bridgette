# My First Ever Snake Game!
Hey there! I'm Bridgette and I'm so excited to share with you my first ever snake game created with `JavaScript`, `CSS`, and, `HTML`! This is the first game I've ever "made public" so I am both nervous and exhilarated! 

## A bit about this game...
I made this from "start to scratch" in 4 days! That is really quick considering how long ago I started learning how to code! I started learning how to code in June of 2021 and this was completed on October 27th 2021! I did the original code along with a tutorial from one of my favorite Developer education companies, [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) and then I took it from there with designing and styling the project all on my own! This was also the first time that I ever made a *Hamburger Menu* styled navbar! I found a simplistic boilerplate [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At4B7A4GOPg&t=600s), and took it from there! I am still not fully done with what I have envisioned but was so excited to finally have a project I'm willing to display for my portfolio I figured that this will be a good way to show off my work! (Also, show off the work that is to come in the "*About*" and "*Mode FAQ*" pages of the web app!)

I will also be uploading some, perhaps even **all**, of the notes I'd taken while working through this project initially with the Scrimba instructor as well as once I branched off on my own. 

## To run: 
1. I developed this using VS-Code. Because it is a very simple and straight forward project you should be able to just download the zip. From there just open it up with VS Code and navigate to the `index.html` file in the root of the project. 

2. If you have the VS Code extension, [Live Server](ritwickdey.liveserver), it will be incredibly easy for you to start up the web app! By right clicking while in the `index.html` file (located in the root of the project) you should be able to find the "*Open With Live Server*" option. If you don't have this extension downloaded, please consider it as it makes Front-End Development much more easy and convenient! 

3. From there you should be able to check it out for yourself! Give it a try and let me know what you think!
